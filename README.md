# 🧩 CRUD with MongoDB, Node.js, Express and Next.js

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using:

- 🟢 **MongoDB** as the database
- ⚙️ **Node.js** as the JavaScript runtime environment
- 🚂 **Express** as the backend framework
- ⚡ **Next.js** as the frontend framework (React + SSR)

The goal of this project is to provide a solid foundation for building modern web applications with a decoupled yet integrated full-stack architecture.

> ✅ The application is designed to run both the API and the frontend together in development. It supports separation of concerns and is ready for deployment on platforms like Vercel (frontend) and Render or Railway (backend).

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OscarEsc10/CrudNode.git
cd CrudJavascript/CrudJS
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Create the `.env` file**

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://Oscar:101120@cluster.mongodb.net/CrudDB
PORT=3000
```


## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API will be served via custom Express routes or via Next.js API routes.

## 📬 API Endpoints

> Example base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api`

| Method | Endpoint       | Description               |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| GET    | `/stars`       | Fetch all user            |
| GET    | `/stars/:id`   | Fetch a single user       |
| POST   | `/stars`       | Create a new user         |
| PUT    | `/stars/:id`   | Update an existing user   |
| DELETE | `/stars/:id`   | Delete an user            |

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

You can deploy the frontend (Next.js) and backend (Express) separately.

### Frontend (Next.js)

Use **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** or **Netlify** for frontend hosting.

Steps:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect the repo on Vercel
3. Set environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)
4. Deploy

### Backend (Express API)

Use **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku**.

Steps:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repo to chosen platform
3. Add your `.env` variables (especially `MONGODB_URI`)
4. Deploy and test API

## 🧠 Best Practices

- ✅ Modular file structure for scalability
- ✅ Mongoose used for schema and validation
- ✅ Next.js with SSR for SEO and performance
- ✅ Clean `.gitignore` and `.env` practices
- ✅ API routes separated from views
